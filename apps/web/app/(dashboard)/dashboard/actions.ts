 * can show it inline and let the founder fix it, the same useActionState shape
 * runOnboardingAction already established) and creates the business immediately from a
 * placeholder name derived from the domain -- unchanged from before.
 *
 * What changed from the old synchronous version: this action no longer calls the AI
 * itself. Understanding the website used to run inline here (blocking the redirect on
 * one whole research+structure call, with a failure only ever logged to the server
 * console -- invisible to the founder, and not "recoverable" in any real sense). Now it
 * only records a `pending` discovery.website_onboarding_runs row and redirects
 * immediately; the actual research happens on the Business detail page itself (a
 * WebsiteOnboardingPanel driving the new streaming route handler), where its progress is
 * visible, a failure is shown with a real Retry action, and the founder reviews every
 * extracted field -- including business_name/description -- before anything is applied,
 * rather than having it silently overwrite the business's own name/description the way
 * the old inline call did.
