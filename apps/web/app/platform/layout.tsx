 * PLATFORM-P0-01's control-plane shell -- a new top-level `apps/web/app/platform/`
 * segment, not nested inside `(dashboard)`, so it shares none of the customer app's
 * sidebar/topbar chrome (docs/plan/09-PLATFORM-ADMIN-PORTAL-BACKLOG.md §3: "must not be
 * implemented as a normal customer/business account with elevated UI permissions").
 *
 * `requireSuperadmin()` here is the real authorization boundary for every `/platform/*`
 * page (PLATFORM-P0-01.2: "every /platform/* route... must independently verify...
 * Never rely only on hiding navigation") -- redirecting a non-superadmin back to the
 * customer dashboard, same pattern `/dashboard/admin`'s own page already uses for its
 * narrower env-var-only gate. The header below is PLATFORM-P0-01.3's own requirement:
 * "the UI must clearly indicate Platform Administration / SUPERADMIN."
 *
 * PLATFORM-P0-19.1 ("Dedicated Admin Layout", §33) replaces the one-line nav strip this
 * file carried since PLATFORM-P0-03.1 with a real grouped sidebar (`platform-shell.tsx`
 * + `platform-nav.ts`) -- this file now only does the authorization/session work and
 * hands off rendering. Every route the old flat strip listed is still reachable, just
 * grouped; see `platform-nav.ts`'s own docstring for the grouping rationale.
