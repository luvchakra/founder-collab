/**
 * PLATFORM-P0-19.1 ("Dedicated Admin Layout", docs/plan/09-PLATFORM-ADMIN-PORTAL-
 * BACKLOG.md §33) -- the grouped nav model for the real `/platform` sidebar, replacing
 * the flat `NAV_LINKS` strip `platform/layout.tsx` carried since PLATFORM-P0-01/03.1.
 *
 * Every one of the ~18 routes that flat strip already listed is preserved here verbatim
 * (same href, same label) -- this file only adds grouping, it drops nothing. Grouping
 * follows the doc's own §33 mockup ("Dashboard / Branding / Plans / Entitlements /
 * Modules / AI / Countries / Integrations / Policies / Operations / Audit") where a group
 * matches a route we've actually built, and otherwise groups adjacent already-shipped
 * pages under a heading not literally in that mockup (the mockup is illustrative, not
 * exhaustive -- every route it doesn't name still needs a home):
 *
 * - "Entitlements" isn't its own top-level route -- it's `/platform/plans/[id]/
 *   entitlements`, reached from a plan's own detail page, so it has no separate nav
 *   entry (same reason Plans' own `[id]` detail routes never got one).
 * - "Countries" (the mockup's label) is this platform's already-shipped "Compliance
 *   Packs" page (PLATFORM-P0-13) -- grouped under "Compliance" to match the label users
 *   already see on that page's own `<h1>`, not the mockup's generic placeholder.
 * - "Modules & Features" groups Modules with Feature Flags -- both are operational
 *   toggles over what capabilities exist/are visible, distinct from AI/Communications
 *   policy config.
 * - "AI" groups all four AI admin pages (Providers/Routing/Feature Policies/Usage), same
 *   as the mockup.
 * - "Communications" (not in the mockup) groups Email Provider/Email Templates/
 *   Notification Policies -- three pages the mockup doesn't name individually but that
 *   don't fit any of its other named groups.
 * - "Policies" holds Platform Policies (session/password/file/retention/rate-limit
 *   defaults) -- the mockup's own "Policies" group.
 * - "Operations" holds Announcements and Configuration History -- both are ongoing
 *   platform-operations concerns (communicating with customers; auditing/rolling back
 *   config changes), matching the mockup's "Operations" group.
 * - "Audit" (PLATFORM-P0-16, §20) is now its own group, added once that story shipped --
 *   Configuration History (17) stays in Operations, unchanged; Audit Search is the new,
 *   distinct concern (every platform mutation, not just versioned config) so it gets its
 *   own home matching the mockup's own grouping.
