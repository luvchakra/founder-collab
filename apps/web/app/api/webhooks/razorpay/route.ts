/**
 * Razorpay's own webhook -- point Razorpay's dashboard (Settings > Webhooks) at this URL
 * for the `payment.captured` event, and set RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET to the signing secret
 * it gives you there. This is the source of truth for crediting a purchase: the
 * client-reported payment signature (verified by createPendingCreditPurchase's caller,
 * the Billing page's checkout handler) is a same-tab convenience so the UI can update
 * immediately, but a closed tab or a network hiccup right after payment shouldn't mean
 * the founder paid and never got their credits -- this webhook still lands independently
 * of whether the client-side handler ever ran.
