The Service is provided by ${BRAND_NAME} ("${BRAND_NAME}", "we", "us"). By creating an account or using the Service you agree to these Terms. If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other organisation, you confirm that you are authorised to accept these Terms for it, and "you" means that organisation.`;

- Give us accurate information when you sign up, and keep it up to date.
- Keep your password and sign-in methods secure. You are responsible for everything done through your account, including by people you invite to your businesses.

    body: `${BRAND_NAME} is one portal with separately licensed modules — currently Discovery (customer acquisition, marketing and funding), Inventory, Service (field service management), CRM and Finance/GST compliance. You can use only the modules licensed to your business.

We keep improving the Service, so features may be added, changed or retired over time. If we remove a feature you pay for in a way that materially reduces what you get, we will tell you in advance where we reasonably can.

Some features may be labelled beta or preview. They are provided for evaluation, may change without notice and may not be covered by support.`,

    title: "Plans, fees and payment",
    body: `- Current plans and prices are shown on our [pricing page](/pricing). Prices are in Indian Rupees (INR) and exclude applicable taxes such as GST, which are added where required.
- Paid plans are billed in advance for each billing period and renew automatically until cancelled. Fees are not refundable for a partly used period, except where the law requires otherwise.
- AI credit packs are prepaid. Purchased runs stay on your account until used and are not refundable or transferable.
- If a payment fails or is overdue, we may suspend paid features after giving you notice. Your data is kept while an account is suspended (see "Cancellation and your data").
- We may change our prices. A change will not affect a billing period you have already paid for, and we will give you at least 30 days' notice before it applies to you.`,

    body: `You can stop using a module or the whole Service at any time.

- **Cancelling a module never deletes its data.** For 30 days after a module licence ends, its data stays available to you read-only. After that, access to the module is paused but the data is kept, and reactivating the licence restores everything.
- **Closing your account.** Email ${email} from the account owner's address. We will delete or anonymise your data within 90 days of confirming the request, except for anything we must keep by law (for example, tax and invoicing records) or that remains in encrypted backups until they expire.
- **Getting a copy of your data.** Before you leave, you can export records wherever a module offers an export, or email us and we will provide a copy of your data.`,

- **You own your Customer Data.** You give us permission to host, copy, process and display it only as needed to run the Service for you, to keep it secure, and to meet our legal obligations.
- **You are responsible for having the right to use it.** When you add personal data about other people (for example prospects, customers, employees or investors), you are responsible for having a lawful basis to collect and use it, and for giving any notices the law requires. For that data we process it on your behalf and under your instructions.
- We do not sell your Customer Data, and we do not use it to train AI models.

Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) explains how we handle personal data in more detail.`,

    title: "Acceptable use",
    body: `You agree not to use the Service to:

- send spam or unsolicited bulk messages, or contact people in breach of applicable anti-spam, telemarketing or data-protection laws — every outreach email you send must be lawful and honour opt-out requests;
- upload or share anything unlawful, infringing, defamatory, or that you do not have the right to share;
- break the terms of third-party services you connect (for example email providers, WhatsApp, Instagram or Facebook);
- try to access another business's data, probe or test the security of the Service without our written permission, or interfere with its operation;
- copy, reverse-engineer or resell the Service, or scrape it with automated tools;
- carry out any activity that is fraudulent or illegal.

We may remove content or suspend access that breaks these rules. Where it is reasonable to do so, we will tell you first and give you a chance to fix the problem.`,

When you use an AI feature, the content needed for that request is sent to the AI provider that serves it (OpenAI, Anthropic or Google). If you connect your own provider API key, your provider's terms and charges apply to that usage. AI usage is subject to the limits of your plan.`,

    id: "not-advice",
    title: "No professional advice",
    body: `The Service helps you run your business; it does not replace professional advice.

- **Tax and compliance.** GST, e-invoicing, e-way bill and other compliance features are tools to help you prepare and file. You remain responsible for the accuracy of your returns and filings and for meeting your deadlines.
- **Funding.** The Funding features help you organise a fundraise — your investor pipeline, outreach, data room and diligence. They are not investment, legal or securities advice, and ${BRAND_NAME} is not a broker, exchange or fundraising platform. You are responsible for complying with the laws that apply to any offer of securities you make.
- **Accounting and financial reports** are produced from the data you enter; check them with a qualified professional before relying on them.`,

Your use of a third-party service is governed by that provider's own terms, and we are not responsible for the services they provide. If a third-party service changes or stops being available, the related feature of ${BRAND_NAME} may stop working.`,

    body: `To the extent the law allows:

- neither party is liable to the other for indirect, incidental, special or consequential losses, or for loss of profits, revenue, goodwill or data, however caused;
- our total liability arising out of or relating to the Service or these Terms is limited to the amount you paid us for the Service in the 12 months before the event that gave rise to the claim.

Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be limited by law, such as liability for fraud.`,

    title: "Suspension and termination",
    body: `We may suspend or end your access if you seriously or repeatedly break these Terms, if you do not pay fees that are due, or if we are required to by law.

- **Business details:** your business name, address, contact details and registration details such as a GSTIN, and the team members you invite.
- **Content you add:** the records, messages and files you and your team enter or upload — for example prospects, contacts, inventory, jobs, invoices, marketing content, investor records and data-room documents.
- **Messages sent through the Service:** emails you send from ${BRAND_NAME} and the replies they receive, and — if you connect them — messages from channels such as WhatsApp, Instagram or Facebook.
- **Payment details:** when you buy something, our payment provider (Razorpay) collects your card or bank details. We receive only the payment status, amount and reference numbers — never your full card number.
- **AI provider keys:** if you connect your own AI provider API key, we store it encrypted.
- **Technical information:** your IP address, browser and device type, and logs of requests and errors, which our hosting providers record so the Service can run securely.`,

If you connect your own API key, the request is made under your account with that provider and its terms apply. Some Discovery features search the public web for information about companies. AI results are stored in your account so you do not pay for the same request twice.`,

- If you ask us to close your account, we delete or anonymise your data within 90 days of confirming the request, except for records we must keep by law (such as invoices and tax records) and copies in encrypted backups, which are deleted as the backups expire.

- nominate another person to exercise your rights if you die or become incapacitated;
- have a grievance about our handling of your data addressed.
