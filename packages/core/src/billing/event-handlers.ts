/**
 * BILL-35 -- billing emails, sent by the domain-event drain (§61), to the account owners
 * and admins of the business (the people who manage billing). Sent through Resend's HTTP
 * API with the deployment's RESEND_API_KEY / RESEND_FROM_EMAIL, the same sender every
 * other platform email uses. When email isn't configured the event is acknowledged and
 * nothing is sent -- the in-app billing page and bell (BILL-34) still say the same thing.
 * Imported for its side effect from apps/web/app/api/cron/drain-events/route.ts.
