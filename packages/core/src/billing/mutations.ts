 * founder's own browser session can never write a "paid" purchase or credit itself runs
 * directly. `createPendingCreditPurchase` still only ever writes the accountId its own
 * server action resolved from the caller's session (never a client-supplied one), so
 * using the admin client here doesn't open a cross-tenant write -- it's the same
 * authorization the RLS policy would have enforced, just checked in code instead of by
 * Postgres, because a service-role write path was already required for the (fully
 * unauthenticated) payment webhook regardless.
