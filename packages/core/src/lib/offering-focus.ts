/**
 * DISC-OFFER-P0-03.1 "Offering Context Selector": which offering each business was last
 * worked in, so the rail's Customer Acquisition section stays on it while the founder is
 * on a page that names no offering (see `buildDiscoveryNav`'s `rememberedOfferingId`).
 *
 * Client-only storage, the rail's established pattern (`nav-group-folds.ts`): a per-viewer
 * convenience, never a source of truth -- the URL always wins, and an unreadable or stale
 * value just falls back to the first offering.
