 * `PROSPECT_STAGE_LABEL` above it -- that one tracks Discovery's own upstream working
 * stages (research/score/strategy/messages), this one is the wider reference spanning
 * into CRM's own downstream lifecycle; conflating them would lose the "not own CRM
 * lifecycle" distinction the doc itself draws. */
