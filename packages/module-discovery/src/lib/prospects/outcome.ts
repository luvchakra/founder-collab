 * `crm.lead.status` via the already-existing `getDiscoveryHandoffLead` contract call
 * (module-crm/contract/index.ts) -- Discovery never writes to that field, only displays
 * it, the same "reference, don't own" shape `module-crm`'s own `getDiscoveryCrmFunnel`
 * already established in the opposite direction (CRM reading Discovery's own
 * `getProspectFunnelCounts` contract rather than querying Discovery's tables directly).
 *
 * Never stored -- same "derive from what already exists, don't add a column nothing
 * would keep in sync" precedent as `deriveProspectPipelineState` (pipeline.ts) and
 * `computeHandoffStatus` (opportunities/handoff.ts). A rescore, a new message, or a
 * status change on the downstream CRM lead all change this on the next read for free.
