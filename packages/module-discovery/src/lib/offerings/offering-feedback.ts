/**
 * DISC-OFFER-P1-04.1: "Learn From User Edits" -- the doc's own worked example is a single
 * field-level correction ("AI: Target industry = Retail / User: Target industry =
 * Banking"), stored as "structured offering feedback." Scoped to the ICP alone, per this
 * story's own reconnaissance: the ICP is the one entity in this module today whose
 * version history (`icp_profile_versions`, DISC-OFFER-P0-14.2) already tags every
 * snapshot `ai_generated`/`user_edit` -- a real, already-computed signal for "the AI wrote
 * X, a human then changed it to Y," not something requiring new instrumentation. No
 * "quality"/"feedback" concept exists in `00-MASTER-PLAN.md` §5's entity ownership map,
 * so a new table is genuinely warranted, not a duplicate of anything.
 *
 * "Do not silently retrain models" -- this module only ever writes rows to
 * `discovery.offering_feedback`; nothing here (or at either call site) feeds a prompt,
 * a model choice, or any other AI-facing parameter. It is a capture mechanism, not a
 * learning loop -- acting on this data is explicitly out of this story's own scope.
 *
 * These are every content field `icp_profiles`/`icp_profile_versions` mirror exactly
 * (excludes `status`/`confidence`/`evidence`/`version` -- those describe the AI's own
 * confidence or workflow state, not a claim a founder corrects the *value* of). Kept as
 * a single source of truth for both the TS union below and the DB write path
 * (`lib/icp/mutations.ts`) -- the migration's own check constraint on `field_name` must
 * list the exact same fourteen values; if this list ever changes, so must that
 * constraint (same "two things must stay in sync by hand" precedent already accepted for
 * `icp_profiles`/`icp_profile_versions`' own identical column shape).

 * Pure and deterministic (CLAUDE.md dev principle #4 -- no LLM for a computable diff).
 * Compares the AI's last-written content for one ICP against what a founder just saved
 * over it, field by field, and returns one entry per field that actually changed value --
 * an unedited field contributes nothing, so "no changes" returns an empty list rather
 * than a placeholder.
 *
 * Caller is responsible for calling this ONLY when `aiFields` is genuinely known to be
 * the AI's own last claim (i.e. the version being overwritten was tagged
 * `ai_generated` in `icp_profile_versions`) -- this function has no way to check that
 * itself, and doing so here would require a DB round trip inside otherwise-pure logic.
 *
 * Deliberately exact-order array comparison, not a set comparison -- a founder who
 * merely reorders an unchanged list of industries would register as a "correction" here.
 * Flagged as a simplification (CLAUDE.md dev principle #1, simplest implementation that
 * works): the doc's own worked example is a single-value change, not a reordering, and
 * this module has no existing precedent for order-insensitive list comparison to reuse.
