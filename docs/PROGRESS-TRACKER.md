# WonderArk platform — progress tracker

<!-- GENERATED FILE — do not edit by hand. Run `npm run build:progress`. -->

Every story in every backlog under `docs/plan/`, and whether it is built. Generated
from the backlogs themselves plus the repository: this codebase cites a story's id in
the code, migration or test that implements it, so a story whose id appears outside
`docs/plan/` has been worked and one whose id appears nowhere has not. Where that
evidence does not apply — the short ids of the platform build-out epics, a story
deliberately deferred, one built before the citing convention — the status is curated
in `docs/progress-overrides.json`, with a note saying why. ❔ Unverified means the id
appears only in an audit or test-case document: somebody wrote about the story, but no
code cites it, so it is counted as outstanding rather than assumed shipped.

Regenerate after finishing a story: `npm run build:progress`. `npm test` fails if this
file is stale, so it cannot quietly drift out of date.
