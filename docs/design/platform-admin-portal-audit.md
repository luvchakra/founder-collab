# Platform Administration Portal — Audit Log

Dated record of every story implemented from `docs/plan/09-PLATFORM-ADMIN-PORTAL-BACKLOG.md`
(the "WonderArc Platform Administration Portal — P0/P1" doc). Branch: `feature/platform-admin-portal`,
per that doc's own §39 workflow -- **one story at a time, tested, committed, then stop and
wait for the next story** (explicitly not the auto-continue pattern used for other
backlogs in this repo). Never merged into `main` unless explicitly instructed.

## Pre-implementation reconnaissance (Rule 1 — done once, up front)

- **Existing platform-admin precedent**: `packages/core/src/rbac/platform-admin.ts` already
  gates `/dashboard/admin` (currently just a demo-data seed/delete tool) via a pure
  `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS` env var check (`isPlatformAdminEmail()`/`requirePlatformAdmin()`,
  ported from stockpilot-ai-ops). Real, but too primitive for what this backlog asks
  (no DB row, no auditability, no per-role extensibility) -- reused as a **bootstrap**
  path (so the very first SUPERADMIN can always get in) rather than replaced.
- **Identity model**: `auth.users(id)` is the canonical identity anchor across
  `core.account_members`/`core.business_members`/`core.employees`, all via `user_id`.
  `platform.admins.user_id` follows the same convention -- a SUPERADMIN is a raw auth
  user, no account/business/employee row required (matches §5's "No Tenant Context
  Required").
- **RBAC pattern to mirror**: `core.has_permission(business_id, key)` -- `security
  definer`, `stable`, `set search_path`, revoke from public/anon + grant execute to
  authenticated. `platform.is_superadmin()` copies this shape exactly, scoped to
  `auth.uid()` with no business_id (platform authorization has no tenant axis).
- **Entity-ownership map** (`docs/plan/00-MASTER-PLAN.md` §5): no `platform` schema or
  concept exists there today -- genuinely new, not a duplicate of anything (non-negotiable
  #5 check passed). CLAUDE.md's non-negotiable #1 schema list (`core, discovery,
  inventory, fsm, crm, gst`) is updated in the same commit to add `platform`, matching
  the doc's own §3 "Recommended conceptual schemas" and the workflow rule "if the story
  revealed the plan was wrong, update the plan doc in the same commit" -- the user's own
  request to implement this doc is the explicit approval CLAUDE.md's non-negotiable #10
  requires for an architecture change.
- **Route/layout separation**: `/platform` is a **new top-level segment** in
  `apps/web/app/` (not nested inside the `(dashboard)` route group), so it gets its own
  layout tree with none of the customer sidebar/topbar chrome -- satisfies §3's "not a
  normal customer/business account with elevated UI permissions" structurally, not just
  by convention.
- **`scripts/lint-migration-schema.mjs`**: `KNOWN_SCHEMAS` is a hardcoded set: needs
  `"platform"` added or every `platform.*` migration fails the schema-qualification check.
- **No new workspace package**: `packages/core` already hosts every cross-cutting
  concern (rbac, licensing, audit, admin). Platform-level server logic grows there
  (`src/rbac/platform-admin.ts`, and a future `src/platform/` for platform.*-schema
  queries/mutations as later stories need them) rather than a new `packages/module-*`
  package -- platform admin isn't a licensable customer module, so the module-registry/
  `lint:boundaries` machinery doesn't apply to it and shouldn't be forced to.

## Story log

### PLATFORM-P0-01 — SUPERADMIN (2026-09-11)

New `platform` schema (first-ever platform-owned entity) + `platform.admins` (`user_id`
-> `auth.users`, `role` text with a check constraint currently allowing only
`'superadmin'` -- a column, not a hardcoded enum type, specifically so §32/18.3's future
roles (`PLATFORM_ADMIN`, `BILLING_ADMIN`, `SUPPORT_ADMIN`, `OPERATIONS_ADMIN`,
`SECURITY_ADMIN`) can be added by widening the constraint later, never by restructuring
the table). Soft-revoke (`revoked_at`/`revoked_by`/`revoke_reason`), rows never deleted --
same "history is never destroyed" discipline `core.audit_log`-adjacent tables already
follow, and this table's own rows are exactly the kind of high-risk history §20's future
audit trail will need to reconstruct.

`platform.is_superadmin(p_user_id uuid default auth.uid())` mirrors
`core.has_permission()`'s exact shape (`security definer`, `stable`,
`set search_path = platform`, revoke from public/anon, grant execute to authenticated) --
the actual authorization boundary, not just an application-code check. RLS is enabled on
`platform.admins` with one policy (`select` gated on `is_superadmin()` itself, the same
safe self-referencing-via-security-definer-function pattern `core.api_keys`' own policies
already use) -- no insert/update/delete policy yet, since granting/revoking superadmin
access is its own future, separately-audited capability (§20/§32); until it exists, rows
are migration/service-role-seeded only, matching `core.permissions`/`core.role_permissions`'
own "no builder yet" scope.

`packages/core/src/rbac/platform-admin.ts` gets two new exports, `isSuperadmin()`/
`requireSuperadmin()` -- checked first against the existing `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS`
bootstrap list (so the very first SUPERADMIN is never locked out before any DB row
exists), then against `platform.is_superadmin()`. The pre-existing
`isPlatformAdminEmail()`/`requirePlatformAdmin()` (gating `/dashboard/admin`) are left
untouched -- a different, already-shipped feature, not this story's to refactor.

`packages/core/src/db/middleware.ts`: the auth wall (`isProtected`) now also covers
`/platform`, so an unauthenticated visitor is redirected to `/login` the same way
`/dashboard` already is -- extracted into a small `isProtectedPath()` helper (mirroring
`activeBusinessIdFromPath()`'s own testable-pure-function shape) rather than inlining a
second prefix check. The license-gate block beneath it is unaffected: it already only
runs when `activeBusinessIdFromPath()` finds a business id, which no `/platform/*` path
ever will -- satisfies §5's PLATFORM-P0-01.4 "No Tenant Context Required" for free,
without a special case.

New `apps/web/app/platform/layout.tsx` -- the real authorization boundary
(`requireSuperadmin()`, redirecting a non-superadmin to `/dashboard` the same way
`/dashboard/admin`'s own page already does) plus a minimal header clearly reading
"WonderArc Platform Administration" / a "SUPERADMIN" badge (§5's PLATFORM-P0-01.3),
visually distinct from the customer dashboard chrome (no shared sidebar/topbar
components). New `apps/web/app/platform/page.tsx` is a deliberately minimal placeholder
proving the gate end-to-end -- the real Dashboard (§6, PLATFORM-P0-02) is its own,
separate next story, not built ahead of turn.

Verified with full monorepo typecheck, `node scripts/lint-import-boundaries.mjs`,
`node scripts/lint-migration-schema.mjs` (after adding `"platform"` to `KNOWN_SCHEMAS`),
`npx vitest run --root packages/core` (new `isProtectedPath()` cases), a live migration
apply + `get_advisors` for both `security`/`performance`, and a clean `next build`.

**Status**: PLATFORM-P0-01 done. Stopping here per the doc's own §39 workflow --
waiting for the next story (PLATFORM-P0-02, Platform Dashboard, is next in Phase 1's own
order, but nothing auto-continues).

### PLATFORM-P0-02 — Platform Dashboard (2026-09-11)

New `packages/core/src/admin/platform-dashboard-queries.ts` -- three service-role query
functions (`getPlatformOverview()`, `getConfigurationHealth()`, `getRecentGlobalChanges()`)
following `admin/queries.ts`'s own already-established pattern exactly:
`createAdminClient({ schema: "core" })`, no RLS bypass concerns because the only caller is
`/platform`, which sits under `requireSuperadmin()` (PLATFORM-P0-01's own layout). No
migration needed -- every metric reads existing `core` tables (`businesses`,
`account_members`, `licenses`, `ai_runs`, `api_keys`, `api_rate_limit_counters`,
`domain_events`, `license_events`, `ai_provider_credentials`), nothing new to store.

**PLATFORM-P0-02.1 (Platform Overview)**: businesses, active users (distinct
`account_members.user_id`), active licenses (a proxy for "active subscriptions" -- there
is no separate subscription/billing entity yet), per-module license counts, 30-day AI
usage (`ai_runs` count + summed `estimated_cost`), 24h API usage
(`api_rate_limit_counters`), and open platform issues (`domain_events` stuck at
`status = 'failed'`). MRR/ARR is deliberately rendered as "--" with a note pointing at
PLATFORM-P0-04 rather than computed: nothing in `core` prices a license or plan yet
(`core.business_settings.plan` is a free-text label, not a billing entity) -- a fabricated
number would violate CLAUDE.md's "never implement speculative functionality" worse than an
honest gap. No customer PII surfaced anywhere (§6.1) -- every widget is a count, a sum, or
a business *name*.

**PLATFORM-P0-02.2 (Configuration Health)**: all seven categories the doc lists (AI
providers, payment provider, email, WhatsApp, country packs, subscription plans, feature
flags) honestly report `configured: false` today, each with a `detail` string naming the
future story that will wire it up (PLATFORM-P0-09/11/12/13/04/08) -- none of those
platform-wide config surfaces exist yet, so nothing here is fabricated. The one category
with a narrower real signal (per-business BYOK `ai_provider_credentials`) surfaces that
count in its own detail text explicitly labeled as *not* the platform-wide provider
registry PLATFORM-P0-09 will add, rather than being folded into a false "configured".

**PLATFORM-P0-02.3 (Recent Global Changes)**: reads `core.license_events` (module
activated/deactivated/reactivated/expired across every business) -- the only genuinely
platform-wide "something changed" ledger that exists yet. Future stories add their own
sources once they exist (PLATFORM-P0-04 plan changes, PLATFORM-P0-08's flag audit,
PLATFORM-P0-15 announcements) rather than this story fabricating a generic events table
ahead of that need.

`apps/web/app/platform/page.tsx` rewritten from PLATFORM-P0-01's placeholder into the real
dashboard -- three sections (Overview KPI grid, Configuration Health list, Recent Global
Changes feed), reusing the Executive Dashboard's own `KpiCard`/`Card`/`Badge` composition
pattern (`apps/web/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`) but with the platform layout's own
dark zinc palette instead of the customer app's theme tokens (explicit `border-zinc-700
text-zinc-300` override on the "Not configured" badge, since the shadcn `outline` variant's
`text-foreground` would otherwise resolve against the site's normal light-theme tokens,
unreadable on this hardcoded dark chrome).

`apps/web/app/platform/layout.tsx` gets one addition: `export const dynamic =
"force-dynamic"`. Discovered via a real build failure -- `next build` attempted to
statically prerender `/platform` and executed the new service-role queries at build time,
throwing on a missing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in an environment with no `.env.local`.
Every `/platform/*` page is a per-request authenticated control-plane view by design, never
a static-generation candidate, so this is forced explicitly rather than relying on Next's
dynamic-API auto-detection (which apparently doesn't trip early enough here to prevent the
prerender attempt from reaching page-level code).

Verified with full monorepo typecheck, `node scripts/lint-import-boundaries.mjs` (1003
files), `node scripts/lint-migration-schema.mjs` (107 migrations, unchanged -- no new
migration this story), `npx vitest run --root packages/core` (37 tests, unchanged -- no new
pure logic worth a unit test beyond what the sibling `admin/queries.ts` already
establishes as this codebase's pattern for thin service-role query wrappers), and a clean
`next build` after the `force-dynamic` fix (`/platform` now listed `ƒ` dynamic).

**Status**: PLATFORM-P0-02 done. Stopping here per the doc's own §39 workflow -- waiting
for the next story (PLATFORM-P0-16, Platform Audit, or PLATFORM-P0-18, Platform Security
Controls, are next in Phase 1's own order, but nothing auto-continues).

### PLATFORM-P0-18.1 — MFA Required for SUPERADMIN (2026-09-11)

§32's four security stories (18.1-18.4) split across this run and the next as scoped by
the assignment: **18.1 (MFA) built this story**; 18.2 (reauthentication) and 18.4
(destructive-action protection) explicitly **deferred** below since neither has a real
caller yet; 18.3 (least privilege) needs **no new code** -- already satisfied by
PLATFORM-P0-01's own `platform.admins.role` design, confirmed below rather than assumed.

**What was built**: a new route group, `apps/web/app/platform/(protected)/`, with its own
`layout.tsx` that calls the Supabase JS SDK's `auth.mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel()`
and redirects to `/platform/mfa` unless `currentLevel === "aal2"`. This is the first MFA
feature anywhere in the codebase -- there was no prior scaffolding to build on beyond the
SDK's own `auth.mfa.*` methods, so this story is the origin of that pattern, not a port of
one. The existing dashboard page built in PLATFORM-P0-02
(`apps/web/app/platform/page.tsx`) moved unchanged (`git mv`, no content edits) to
`apps/web/app/platform/(protected)/page.tsx` -- it's the one page this AAL2 gate protects
today; every future `/platform/*` page lands in this same group automatically as it's
added, with no per-page opt-in required.

`apps/web/app/platform/layout.tsx` (PLATFORM-P0-01's outer shell) is **untouched** --
its `requireSuperadmin()` identity check still runs for every `/platform/*` route,
including `/platform/mfa` itself. AAL2 is a strictly additional, independent layer on top
of that identity check, not a replacement for it, exactly as scoped: a non-superadmin who
somehow completed TOTP verification still gets redirected to `/dashboard` by the outer
layout, before the AAL2 gate is ever reached.

New sibling route `apps/web/app/platform/mfa/` (page.tsx + actions.ts +
mfa-verify-form.tsx) -- deliberately **outside** `(protected)/`, as the story requires: a
not-yet-verified superadmin visiting `/platform/mfa` must not itself be redirected back to
`/platform/mfa` by the very layout it's trying to satisfy. `page.tsx` is a server component
that branches on the actual MFA state rather than only handling first-time enrollment
(the story's two named SDK calls, `auth.mfa.enroll` and `auth.mfa.challengeAndVerify`,
don't by themselves cover the equally-necessary "already enrolled from a previous session,
just needs a fresh challenge" path -- a superadmin who signs out and back in only reaches
AAL1 again, and without this branch they'd hit a broken re-enroll flow every single login):

- **No verified TOTP factor** (first-time setup): any stale *unverified* factor from an
  abandoned earlier attempt is unenrolled first -- its secret/QR can never be re-displayed
  once that page load is gone, so leaving it around would only accumulate dead factors on
  every retry -- then a fresh one is enrolled via `auth.mfa.enroll({ factorType: "totp" })`
  and its QR code (rendered directly from the SDK's returned `data:image/svg+xml` string)
  and manual-entry secret are shown above the code form.
- **A verified TOTP factor already exists** but the session is still AAL1: skips
  enrollment entirely and shows only the code-entry form against that existing factor.

Both paths converge on the same `verifyMfaCode` server action
(`apps/web/app/platform/mfa/actions.ts`), which calls
`auth.mfa.challengeAndVerify({ factorId, code })` -- correct for both cases, since it
creates the challenge and verifies the code in one round trip regardless of whether the
factor was just enrolled or already verified. On success it `redirect()`s to `/platform`,
where the `(protected)` layout's AAL2 check now passes. The action/`useActionState`
shape mirrors `apps/web/app/(auth)/actions.ts` exactly (a `(prevState, formData) => state |
null` function, an `{ error: string } | null` state type, `redirect()` on success), and
`mfa-verify-form.tsx` mirrors `apps/web/components/auth/auth-form.tsx`'s client-component
shape (`useActionState` + a hidden field + `SubmitButton`) -- no new form convention
invented for this one page.

Per the story's explicit instruction, the code field is a plain `<Input type="text"
inputMode="numeric" pattern="[0-9]{6}" maxLength={6}>` -- **not** the vendored
`packages/core/src/components/ui/input-otp.tsx` component, which would add multi-box
focus-management complexity this one low-traffic, admin-only screen doesn't need
(CLAUDE.md development principle #1, "prefer the simplest implementation that works").

**A real typing quirk found along the way**: `@supabase/supabase-js`'s own types make
`listFactors()`'s per-type `totp`/`phone` arrays generic over `Factor<K, 'verified'>` --
i.e. by the SDK's own typing, entries in `data.totp` are always already verified;
unverified factors surface only in `data.all`. An `f.status === "unverified"` filter on
`data.totp` is therefore a compile error (`no overlap` between the literal types), not a
typo -- confirmed by reading `node_modules/@supabase/auth-js/dist/module/lib/types.d.ts`
directly rather than guessing at a cast. The code above filters `data.all` by
`factor_type === "totp" && status === "unverified"` for cleanup, and treats
`data.totp[0]`'s mere presence as "a verified factor exists" for the branch decision --
both correct per that type, not a workaround.

**PLATFORM-P0-18.3 (Least Privilege) -- checked, not built**: `platform.admins.role` is a
plain `text` column with a check constraint (PLATFORM-P0-01), not a hardcoded enum type or
a single-role boolean flag -- widening the constraint to admit `PLATFORM_ADMIN`,
`BILLING_ADMIN`, `SUPPORT_ADMIN`, `OPERATIONS_ADMIN`, `SECURITY_ADMIN` later needs no table
restructuring. Confirmed by re-reading the migration and `platform.is_superadmin()`'s
definition rather than assuming the story's own note was still accurate. No code changes
made for this sub-story, matching the assignment's instruction.

**PLATFORM-P0-18.2 (Reauthentication for high-risk actions) and PLATFORM-P0-18.4
(Destructive-action protection) -- explicitly deferred, not built**: both require actual
mutation server actions to attach to (changing AI secrets, disabling a module, typed
confirmation for a destructive operation, etc.), and this codebase has **zero** platform
mutation server actions today -- everything under `/platform/*` so far (P0-01's shell,
P0-02's dashboard, this story's MFA flow) is read-only or auth-plumbing. Building
reauthentication/confirmation machinery now, with nothing to attach it to, would be
exactly the kind of speculative functionality CLAAUDE.md's development principle #7
forbids. Both remain open until PLATFORM-P0-04 (Plans) or a later mutation-adding story
gives them a real caller.

**Verification**: full monorepo `npm run typecheck` -- clean except two pre-existing
unrelated errors (`gst/layout.tsx`'s `action` vs `countryAction`/`regimeAction` prop
mismatch, and `EvidenceItem.claim` in the prospects page), confirmed pre-existing via
`git log` on both files (last touched by unrelated COMPLY/Discovery commits, not this
story) and via `git diff HEAD --name-only` showing neither file touched here. `npm run
lint` -- 0 errors, 1 pre-existing unrelated warning (`Package` unused import in a CRM
conversations page, also untouched by this story). `node scripts/lint-import-boundaries.mjs`
-- 1007 files, no violations. `node scripts/lint-migration-schema.mjs` -- 107 migrations,
unchanged (no migration this story -- MFA state lives entirely in Supabase Auth's own
`auth.mfa_factors`/`auth.mfa_challenges` tables, not `core`/`platform` schema, matching the
assignment's own note). `npx vitest run --root packages/core` -- 37 tests, unchanged (the
AAL2 check is a two-line comparison against the SDK's own return value, not pure logic
worth a unit test beyond what `isProtectedPath()` already established as this codebase's
bar for that in PLATFORM-P0-01). `apps/web`'s own `vitest run --passWithNoTests` -- 40
tests, unchanged. `cd apps/web && npm run build` -- clean; `/platform` and `/platform/mfa`
both list `ƒ` (dynamic), confirming the outer layout's existing `force-dynamic` (from
PLATFORM-P0-02) correctly covers the new nested route group and the new sibling route
without needing its own copy.

**Limitation, stated plainly**: there is no seeded demo superadmin user or working MFA
test harness in this sandboxed environment (no live Supabase project reachable, no way to
scan a real QR code against a real authenticator app). A live authenticated browser
walkthrough of the actual enroll -> scan -> verify -> land-on-dashboard flow was **not**
performed and is **not** claimed here -- this entry documents build/typecheck/lint
correctness and a read of the actual SDK types and runtime contract, not an end-to-end UI
verification, exactly as every prior story in this log has done when the same gap applied.

**Status**: PLATFORM-P0-18.1 done (18.2/18.4 deferred, 18.3 confirmed already satisfied).
Stopping here per the doc's own §39 workflow -- waiting for the next story (most likely
PLATFORM-P0-16, Platform Audit, or continuing Phase 1's remaining security scope, per the
doc's own recommended order -- but nothing auto-continues).
