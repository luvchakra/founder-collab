# Platform Administration Portal — Audit Log

Dated record of every story implemented from `docs/plan/09-PLATFORM-ADMIN-PORTAL-BACKLOG.md`
(the "WonderArc Platform Administration Portal — P0/P1" doc). Branch: `feature/platform-admin-portal`,
per that doc's own §39 workflow -- **one story at a time, tested, committed, then stop and
wait for the next story** (explicitly not the auto-continue pattern used for other
backlogs in this repo). Never merged into `main` unless explicitly instructed.

## Pre-implementation reconnaissance (Rule 1 — done once, up front)

- **Existing platform-admin precedent**: `packages/core/src/rbac/platform-admin.ts` already
  gates `/dashboard/admin` (currently just a demo-data seed/delete tool) via a pure
  `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS` env var check (`isPlatformAdminEmail()`/`requirePlatformAdmin()`,
  ported from stockpilot-ai-ops). Real, but too primitive for what this backlog asks
  (no DB row, no auditability, no per-role extensibility) -- reused as a **bootstrap**
  path (so the very first SUPERADMIN can always get in) rather than replaced.
- **Identity model**: `auth.users(id)` is the canonical identity anchor across
  `core.account_members`/`core.business_members`/`core.employees`, all via `user_id`.
  `platform.admins.user_id` follows the same convention -- a SUPERADMIN is a raw auth
  user, no account/business/employee row required (matches §5's "No Tenant Context
  Required").
- **RBAC pattern to mirror**: `core.has_permission(business_id, key)` -- `security
  definer`, `stable`, `set search_path`, revoke from public/anon + grant execute to
  authenticated. `platform.is_superadmin()` copies this shape exactly, scoped to
  `auth.uid()` with no business_id (platform authorization has no tenant axis).
- **Entity-ownership map** (`docs/plan/00-MASTER-PLAN.md` §5): no `platform` schema or
  concept exists there today -- genuinely new, not a duplicate of anything (non-negotiable
  #5 check passed). CLAUDE.md's non-negotiable #1 schema list (`core, discovery,
  inventory, fsm, crm, gst`) is updated in the same commit to add `platform`, matching
  the doc's own §3 "Recommended conceptual schemas" and the workflow rule "if the story
  revealed the plan was wrong, update the plan doc in the same commit" -- the user's own
  request to implement this doc is the explicit approval CLAUDE.md's non-negotiable #10
  requires for an architecture change.
- **Route/layout separation**: `/platform` is a **new top-level segment** in
  `apps/web/app/` (not nested inside the `(dashboard)` route group), so it gets its own
  layout tree with none of the customer sidebar/topbar chrome -- satisfies §3's "not a
  normal customer/business account with elevated UI permissions" structurally, not just
  by convention.
- **`scripts/lint-migration-schema.mjs`**: `KNOWN_SCHEMAS` is a hardcoded set: needs
  `"platform"` added or every `platform.*` migration fails the schema-qualification check.
- **No new workspace package**: `packages/core` already hosts every cross-cutting
  concern (rbac, licensing, audit, admin). Platform-level server logic grows there
  (`src/rbac/platform-admin.ts`, and a future `src/platform/` for platform.*-schema
  queries/mutations as later stories need them) rather than a new `packages/module-*`
  package -- platform admin isn't a licensable customer module, so the module-registry/
  `lint:boundaries` machinery doesn't apply to it and shouldn't be forced to.

## Story log

### PLATFORM-P0-01 — SUPERADMIN (2026-09-11)

New `platform` schema (first-ever platform-owned entity) + `platform.admins` (`user_id`
-> `auth.users`, `role` text with a check constraint currently allowing only
`'superadmin'` -- a column, not a hardcoded enum type, specifically so §32/18.3's future
roles (`PLATFORM_ADMIN`, `BILLING_ADMIN`, `SUPPORT_ADMIN`, `OPERATIONS_ADMIN`,
`SECURITY_ADMIN`) can be added by widening the constraint later, never by restructuring
the table). Soft-revoke (`revoked_at`/`revoked_by`/`revoke_reason`), rows never deleted --
same "history is never destroyed" discipline `core.audit_log`-adjacent tables already
follow, and this table's own rows are exactly the kind of high-risk history §20's future
audit trail will need to reconstruct.

`platform.is_superadmin(p_user_id uuid default auth.uid())` mirrors
`core.has_permission()`'s exact shape (`security definer`, `stable`,
`set search_path = platform`, revoke from public/anon, grant execute to authenticated) --
the actual authorization boundary, not just an application-code check. RLS is enabled on
`platform.admins` with one policy (`select` gated on `is_superadmin()` itself, the same
safe self-referencing-via-security-definer-function pattern `core.api_keys`' own policies
already use) -- no insert/update/delete policy yet, since granting/revoking superadmin
access is its own future, separately-audited capability (§20/§32); until it exists, rows
are migration/service-role-seeded only, matching `core.permissions`/`core.role_permissions`'
own "no builder yet" scope.

`packages/core/src/rbac/platform-admin.ts` gets two new exports, `isSuperadmin()`/
`requireSuperadmin()` -- checked first against the existing `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS`
bootstrap list (so the very first SUPERADMIN is never locked out before any DB row
exists), then against `platform.is_superadmin()`. The pre-existing
`isPlatformAdminEmail()`/`requirePlatformAdmin()` (gating `/dashboard/admin`) are left
untouched -- a different, already-shipped feature, not this story's to refactor.

`packages/core/src/db/middleware.ts`: the auth wall (`isProtected`) now also covers
`/platform`, so an unauthenticated visitor is redirected to `/login` the same way
`/dashboard` already is -- extracted into a small `isProtectedPath()` helper (mirroring
`activeBusinessIdFromPath()`'s own testable-pure-function shape) rather than inlining a
second prefix check. The license-gate block beneath it is unaffected: it already only
runs when `activeBusinessIdFromPath()` finds a business id, which no `/platform/*` path
ever will -- satisfies §5's PLATFORM-P0-01.4 "No Tenant Context Required" for free,
without a special case.

New `apps/web/app/platform/layout.tsx` -- the real authorization boundary
(`requireSuperadmin()`, redirecting a non-superadmin to `/dashboard` the same way
`/dashboard/admin`'s own page already does) plus a minimal header clearly reading
"WonderArc Platform Administration" / a "SUPERADMIN" badge (§5's PLATFORM-P0-01.3),
visually distinct from the customer dashboard chrome (no shared sidebar/topbar
components). New `apps/web/app/platform/page.tsx` is a deliberately minimal placeholder
proving the gate end-to-end -- the real Dashboard (§6, PLATFORM-P0-02) is its own,
separate next story, not built ahead of turn.

Verified with full monorepo typecheck, `node scripts/lint-import-boundaries.mjs`,
`node scripts/lint-migration-schema.mjs` (after adding `"platform"` to `KNOWN_SCHEMAS`),
`npx vitest run --root packages/core` (new `isProtectedPath()` cases), a live migration
apply + `get_advisors` for both `security`/`performance`, and a clean `next build`.

**Status**: PLATFORM-P0-01 done. Stopping here per the doc's own §39 workflow --
waiting for the next story (PLATFORM-P0-02, Platform Dashboard, is next in Phase 1's own
order, but nothing auto-continues).
