/**
 * Generates `docs/PROGRESS-TRACKER.md`: one place that says, for every story in every
 * backlog under `docs/plan/`, whether it has been built.
 *
 * **Why it is generated rather than written.** A hand-maintained status list is wrong
 * within a week — somebody ships a story and forgets the tracker, and after that nobody
 * trusts it, which is worse than not having one. So the status comes from the repository
 * itself: this codebase cites its story IDs in the code, migrations and tests that
 * implement them (a convention every epic so far has followed), so a story whose ID
 * appears outside `docs/plan/` has been worked, and one whose ID appears nowhere has not.
 * That is evidence rather than memory, and it updates itself.
 *
 * **Where that is not enough.** Epics 0–7 in `04-CLAUDE-CODE-BACKLOG.md` use short ids
 * (`A-1`, `P-3`, `F-11`) that would match unrelated text all over the repo, so their
 * status is curated in `docs/progress-overrides.json` against the per-epic progress
 * documents instead. The same file records anything else the grep gets wrong — a story
 * deliberately deferred, or one built before the citing convention existed. Every
 * override carries a note saying why, so nothing is asserted without a reason.
 *
 * Usage: `npm run build:progress`. `npm test` fails if the committed tracker is stale.
